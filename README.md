# Physics-based-Animation
My physics based animation project by using GlowScript (web version of VPython)  
In this repository, I programmed all projects on my own.

You don't have to any tool to run my code, just can run on [GlowScript website](https://www.glowscript.org/)

## Project list
### 1. Ballpool simulation
```
  - check Gravity mode / Zero-Gravity mode
  - select and drag ball by using mouse
```
### 2. Buoyancy simulation
```
  - click to drop the wood box
```
### 3. multi springs system simulation
```
  - input how many springs you want to create
  - select and drag ball by using mouse
```
### 4. curling simulation
```
  - slide draw speed
  - click draw button
```
### 5. lunar_lander_simulation_game
```
  - click to make thrust
  - use direction keys to go forward or backward
  - there is fuel limit (run out of 5 fuel every time you click)
```
### 6. Newton_apple_simulation
```
  - click to start
  - check that only x direction velocity is important to x direction distance
```
